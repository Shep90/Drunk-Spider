# Drunk-Spider
A random walker designed as a spider with random movement, and leg placement.

I started out with the idea of a spider moving randomly across the screen. But, after I finalized it's movement, I decided to make the legs move randomly as well. I decided to build the entire code within a class I called Moving, so that I could just call it with one instance for each leg and the corresponding shadow in my sketch.js file. I also made a moving background to show it's movement more clearly as well, and create the illusion of 3D space. Once I had everything moving correctly, I set off to make assets to put in place of the original code, to make it seem more realistic. The only complaints that I have is that I couldn't get the background to move as smoothly as I wanted, and the shadows seem slightly off. All in all, I'm happy with how it turned out. I feel like I could tweak it more to make it closer to perfect, but I think it gets my point across well.
